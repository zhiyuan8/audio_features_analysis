Real-time/file-based audio feature analysis written by Javascript    
The demo for real-time speech/noise classification from web microphone can be found at: https://zhiyuan8.github.io/  
Open the link and press **start**, then your audio features are drawn, and decisions are made every 1s. Press **Export Data** then mid-term features will be shown in a txt file.  

### Training Data
Audios were collected from different resources (see 'Tranining data source' at ReadMe of https://github.com/zhiyuan8/speech_detection).

### Model and Performance
The classification is based on kNN model, but more sophisticated models are being tunned now. Also, more advanced tasks are being tested now.
